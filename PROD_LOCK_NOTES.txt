PROD LOCK NOTES — HibiscusToAirport
==================================

Goal: Keep the production website EXACTLY as customers expect.
Rule: No changes unless explicitly planned and reversible.

Last confirmed LIVE OK:
- Time (NZ): 2026-01-29 07:10:28
- Git commit (local HEAD): e918767
- Domain checks:
  - https://hibiscustoairport.co.nz = 200
  - https://www.hibiscustoairport.co.nz = 200

Freeze rules:
- Do NOT run: npm install, npm audit fix, dependency upgrades
- Do NOT run: vercel --prod --force
- Do NOT change: Vercel domains for hibiscustoairport.co.nz
- Do NOT mix with Dominat8 repo

If something breaks:
- Go to Vercel project 'hibiscus-to-airport'
- Redeploy the last known good Production deployment
- Re-run the two 200 checks above
