## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. **Try Version 3 first** (most basic, least likely to be rejected)
2. **Count characters** - GMB limit is typically 750 characters
3. **Use plain text only** - no formatting
4. **Avoid copy-paste** - type directly into GMB if possible
5. **Save as draft** - then review and publish

## 📝 CHARACTER COUNT CHECK:
- Version 1: ~580 characters
- Version 2: ~340 characters  
- Version 3: ~280 characters

All versions are well under the 750 character limit.

Try Version 3 first - it's the safest option that should definitely work!
